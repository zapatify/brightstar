# README

This rails application is a playground of sorts for me to experiment with. 

This application runs Rails 8.1.1 (I want to experiement with Rails core authentication), and Ruby 3.3.8.  

The default database is Postgres (I also want to experiment with it as well)

The CSS framework is Tailwind, and I want to incorporate Flowbite components in due time. 

The checklist of tasks I would like to accomplish:

- [ ] Enable aunthentication
- [ ] Incorporate GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- [ ] Add Solid Queue and Mission Control (https://github.com/rails/mission_control-jobs)

Also, none of this was done with AI, but rather it's all homegrown (ZI: Zapata Intelligence)
